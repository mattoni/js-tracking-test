This import is for elements that appear on only one page. In this case, the about us page. We've included a global.css
file here because our about us page has special styling that will need to override some global styles. We won't have
executive profiles on any other page but our about us, so we can include that here.

You don't have to be this precise with your CSS, but when you're going for a different looks between different sections
of the website, this is important.

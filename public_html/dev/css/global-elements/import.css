This import is for elements that could appear anywhere on the site and need to be universal in scope. It's not
necessarily a global default restyling, and it's not imperative to render the website, so we call it a global element.
These can be things like newsletter forms, login forms, calls to action. Things that may need to be included anywhere.

The example I gave here is a list of blog items. Maybe we want it on the homepage, maybe we don't.
